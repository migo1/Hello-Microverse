## Install Linters

You can find linters for most of the programming languages, e.g. Rubocop for Ruby or ESLint for JavaScript.

Also, there are many ways you can integrate a linter in your workflow:

-text editor plugin<br>
-GitHub Actions<br>
-GitHub apps<br>

## Set up Linters

**Note:** The npm package manager is going to create a node_modules directory to install all of your dependencies. You shouldn't commit that directory. To avoid that, you can create a .gitignore file and add node_modules to it:

# .gitignore

node_modules/

## Web Hint

This is a customizable linting tool that helps you improve your site's accessibility, speed, cross-browser compatibility, and more by checking your code for best practices and common errors.

**NOTE:** If you are using Windows, make sure you initialize npm to create `package.json` file.

```
npm init -y
```

1. Run
   ```
   npm install --save-dev hint@7.x
   ```
   _how to use npm: (https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)._
2. Copy [.hintrc](.hintrc) to the root directory of your project.
3. **Do not make any changes in config files - they represent style guidelines that you share with your team - which is a group of all Microverse students.**
   - If you think that change is necessary - open a [Pull Request in this repository](../README.md#contributing) and let your code reviewer know about it.
4. Run
   ```
   npx hint .
   ```
5. Fix validation errors.

### [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/)

A mighty, modern linter that helps you avoid errors and enforce conventions in your styles.

1. Run

npm install --save-dev stylelint@13.x stylelint-scss@3.x stylelint-config-standard@21.x stylelint-csstree-validator@1.x
not sure how to use npm? Read this.

2. Copy .stylelintrc.json to the root directory of your project.

3. **Do not make any changes in config files - they represent style guidelines that you share with your team - which is a group of all Microverse students.**

If you think that change is necessary - open a Pull Request in this repository and let your code reviewer know about it. 4. Run npx stylelint "\*_/_.{css,scss}" on the root of your directory of your project.

5. Fix linter errors.

6. **IMPORTANT NOTE:** feel free to research auto-correct options for Stylelint if you get a flood of errors but keep in mind that correcting style errors manually will help you to make a habit of writing a clean code!
